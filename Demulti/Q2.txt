b. What is a good quality score cutoff for index reads and biological read pairs to utilize
for sample identification and downstream analysis, respectively?


Ignoring the first 5 bases as well as the last one because the accuracy is less good on those.
Reads cutoff (for bases past the first 5): 30


Index cutoff (all bases): 30


c. How many indexes have undetermined (N) base calls? (Utilize your command line
tool knowledge. Submit the command you used. CHALLENGE: use a one-line
command)
zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep "N" | wc -l
zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep "N" | wc -l
Index1 has: 3976613
Index2 has: 3328051
total: 7304664
