b. What is a good quality score cutoff for index reads and biological read pairs to utilize
for sample identification and downstream analysis, respectively?

-Gonna be looser with the reads than with the indexes


The first 5 bases on reads always kind of suck and so does the last one so I'm ignoring those
-Basing my cutoff point for reads on the graphs and what looks good
Reads cutoff (for bases past the first 5): 36

Index needs to be for each base and not be tolerant of the ones at the beginning being crappy
-For the index I am setting the cutoff at the average of all the index values
-Average is 35.419081115932
Index cutoff (all bases): 35
